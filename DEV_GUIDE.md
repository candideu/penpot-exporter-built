# Developer guide

The plugin relies in [penpot.js](https://github.com/penpot/penpot-exporter-figma-plugin/blob/main/src/penpot.js)
library. It contains a subset of Penpot frontend app, transpiled into
javascript to be used from js code (this was easy since the frontend is written
in ClojureScript, that has direct translation to javascript).

Basically, it exports the `createFile` function and the `File` data type, that
represents a Penpot file as it resides in memory inside the frontend app. It
has function to create pages and their content, and also an `export` function
that generates and downloads a .zip archive with the Penpot file as svg
documents in Penpot annotated format, that you can import directly into Penpot.

You can see the [source of the library at Penpot repo](https://github.com/penpot/penpot/tree/develop/frontend/src/app/libs).

To see a general description of the data types used in the functions you can
see [the data model](https://help.penpot.app/technical-guide/data-model/).
Their full specifications are in the [common types module](https://github.com/penpot/penpot/tree/develop/common/src/app/common/types).

Those types are defined in [Clojure spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec) format.
For those unfamiliar with the syntax, here is a small basic guide:

```clojure
(s/def ::name string?)
(s/def ::id uuid?)
```

A parameter or attribute called `name` is of type string, and `id` is an *uuid*
string (e.g. "000498f3-27fc-8000-8988-ca7d52f46843").

```clojure
(s/def ::stroke-alignment #{:center :inner :outer})
```

`stroke-alignment` is of an enumerated type, and the valid values are "center",
"inner" and "outer".

```clojure
(ns app.common.types.shape
  (:require
   [app.common.spec :as us]
   ...))

(s/def ::line-height ::us/safe-number)
```

`line-height` is of the type `safe-number`, defined in `app.common.spec`
namespace, that here is imported with the name `us` (a *safe number* is a
integer or floating point number, with a value not too big or small).

```clojure
(s/def ::page
  (s/keys :req-un [::id ::name ::objects ::options]))
```

`page` is an object with four required arguments: `id`, `name`, `objects` and
`options`, whose types have to be defined above.

```clojure
(s/def ::column
  (s/keys :req-un [::color]
          :opt-un [::size
                   ::type
                   ::item-length
                   ::margin
                   ::gutter]))
```

`column` has one required attribute `color` and five optional ones `size`,
`type`, `item-length`, `margin` and `gutter`.

```clojure
(s/def ::children
  (s/coll-of ::content
             :kind vector?
             :min-count 1))
```

`children` is a collection (implemented as a vector) of objects of type
`content`, and must have a minimun lenght of 1.

```clojure
(defmulti animation-spec :animation-type)

(defmethod animation-spec :dissolve [_]
  (s/keys :req-un [::duration
                   ::easing]))

(defmethod animation-spec :slide [_]
  (s/keys :req-un [::duration
                   ::easing
                   ::way
                   ::direction
                   ::offset-effect]))

(defmethod animation-spec :push [_]
  (s/keys :req-un [::duration
                   ::easing
                   ::direction]))

(s/def ::animation
  (s/multi-spec animation-spec ::animation-type))
```

This is probably the most complex construct. `animation` is a multi schema
object. It has an attribute called `animation-type` and the rest of the fields
depend on its value. For example, if `animation-type` is "dissolve", the object
must also have a `duration` and an `easing` attribute.

Other constructs should be more or less auto explicative with this guide
and the clojure.spec manual linked above.
